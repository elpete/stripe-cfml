# stripe-cfml

**stripe-cfml** is a CFML (Lucee and ColdFusion) library for interacting with the Stripe API.

## Installation
This wrapper can be installed as standalone library or as a ColdBox Module. Either approach requires a simple CommandBox command:

```
$ box install stripecfml
```

Alternatively the git repository can be cloned into the desired directory.

### Standalone Usage

Once the library has been installed, the core `stripe` component can be instantiated directly:

```cfc
stripe = new path.to.stripecfml.stripe(
    apiKey = '',
    config = {}
);
```

### ColdBox Module

To use the library as a ColdBox Module, add the init arguments to the `moduleSettings` struct in `config/Coldbox.cfc`:

```cfc
moduleSettings = {
    stripecfml: {
        apiKey: '',
        config: {}
    }
}
```

You can then leverage the library via the injection DSL: `stripe@stripecfml`:

```cfc
property name="stripe" inject="stripe@stripecfml";
```

*Note: You can bypass the init arguments altogether and use Java system properties or environment variables to configure stripe-cfml. See [Configuration via environment variables and system properties](#configuration-via-environment-variables-and-system-properties) below.*

## Getting Started

```cfc
// To charge $20 to a card for which a card token has been created
charge = stripe.charges.create({amount: 2000, currency: 'usd', source: cardToken});
// OR
charge = stripe.charges.create(amount = 2000, currency = 'usd', source = cardToken);

// charge is a struct which can be inspected for the result of the create charge api call
writeDump(charge);
```

**stripe-cfml** is modeled after the official Stripe SDKs. In particular it copies the class and method names used in the Node SDK. The Node examples given in the official Stripe documentation are simply able to be copied and used (with the notable difference that this library does not make use of callbacks - everything is done synchronously). However, since CFML supports named arguments, you can also use named arguments instead of passing the arguments in a single struct.  The following examples are all valid ways of using this library:

```cfc
stripe.customers.updateSource('customer_id', 'source_id', {metadata = {'a': 1}});
stripe.customers.updateSource(customer_id = 'customer_id', source_id = 'source_id', params = {metadata: {'a': 1}});
stripe.customers.updateSource(customer_id = 'customer_id', source_id = 'source_id', metadata = {'a': 1});
```

Note that the `customers` component and the method name, `updateSource`, do not change, only the how the arguments are passed to the method. See the [reference](reference.md) for more information on the method signatures.

## Headers

There are a several arguments you can pass to any method that are passed to the Stripe API as headers: `apiKey`, `stripeVersion` (or `apiVersion`), `idempotencyKey`, and `stripeAccount`.

- `apiKey` and `stripeVersion` will override the default values passed into the `stripe.cfc` init method (see [Configuration](#Configuration) below).
- `idempotencyKey` is used to allow you to make idempotent requests (see https://stripe.com/docs/api#idempotent_requests).
- `stripeAccount` is used when making API requests on behalf of a connected account - see https://stripe.com/docs/connect/authentication.

When copying the Node SDK method signatures, headers are passed in a single struct:

```cfc
charge = stripe.charges.create(
    {amount: 2000, currency: 'usd', source: cardToken},
    {stripeAccount: 'abc', idempotencyKey: 'def'}
);
```

They can also be passed as named arguments:

```cfc
charge = stripe.charges.create(
    amount = 2000,
    currency = 'usd',
    source = cardToken,
    stripeAccount = 'abc',
    idempotencyKey = 'def'
);
// OR
charge = stripe.charges.create(
    params = {amount: 2000, currency: 'usd', source: cardToken},
    headers = {stripeAccount: 'abc', idempotencyKey: 'def'}
);
```

## Configuration

You can pass some configuration parameters in a struct to the constructor of `stripe.cfc`:

```cfc
config = {
    apiVersion: '',
    defaultCurrency: '',
    convertTimestamps: true,
    convertToCents: false
}
stripe = new stripe('stripe_api_key', config);
```

- `apiVersion` specifies the version of the Stripe API to use - see [versioning](https://stripe.com/docs/api#versioning) in the documentation.
- `defaultCurrency` specifies the currency to use when making requests (e.g. `usd`) - when it is specified in the config you do not need to specify it when making requests.
- `convertTimestamps` (default: `true`) - The Stripe API expects all datetimes to be given as Unix timestamps; when this setting is true, `stripe-cfml` converts all CFML date objects passed into methods to UNIX timestamps and converts timestamps in the API responses back to CFML date objects.
- `convertToCents` (default: `false`) - when this is set to `true` all currency amounts passed in are multiplied by 100 and all amounts in the responses are divided by 100. (This enables one to work in dollar amounts instead of cents, if so desired.)

### Configuration via environment variables and system properties

All of these configuration keys, including the Stripe secret key, can be specified in environment variables or Java system properties instead of being passed in at initialization. When using environment variables your config keys should be prefixed with `STRIPE_` and underscores are used to separate words: `STRIPE_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_API_VERSION`, `STRIPE_DEFAULT_CURRENCY`, `STRIPE_CONVERT_TIMESTAMPS`, and `STRIPE_CONVERT_TO_CENTS`. When using system properties your config keys should be prefixed with `stripe.` and all lowercase: `stripe.apikey`, `stripe.apiversion`, `stripe.defaultcurrency`, `stripe.converttimestamps`, and `stripe.converttocents`.

## Responses

The Stripe API returns a JSON object in response to all HTTP requests (see https://stripe.com/docs/api). **stripe-cfml** deserializes this object into a CFML struct and makes it available in a response struct under the `content` key.

Responses to API calls are all returned as structs in the following format:

```cfc
{
    requestId: ''  // request identifier - see https://stripe.com/docs/api#request_ids
    content: {}    // struct containing the body of the response
    duration: 300  // time the HTTP request took in milliseconds
    headers: {}    // struct containing headers returned by the Stripe API
    status: 200    // status code returned by the Stripe API
}
```

## Webhooks

**stripe-cfml** can verify signed webhooks received by your server in a similar fashion to the official Stripe SDKs:

```cfc
try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(webhookJSONPayload, stripeSignatureHeader, endpointSecret);
} catch (any e) {
    // the webhook was not signed properly
}
// otherwise do something with the event

```

See <https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks> and <https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures> for more information on setting up signed webhooks.


### ColdBox Interception Points for Webhooks

ColdBox users can automatically convert incoming webhooks to interception point events.  To do this,
point Stripe at `/stripecfml/webhooks`.  `stripe-cfml` will take care of verifying the validity
of incoming webhooks and announcing the associated interception point.

Interception Points are a combination of `onStripe` and the camelCase version of the webhook type.
For example, a `payment_intent.succeeded` type would become a `onStripePaymentIntentSucceeded` interception
point.  A full list of interception points can be found in the `ModuleConfig.cfc` for this module.

To use this feature, you will need to set your `endpointSecret` in your module settings:

```cfc
moduleSettings = {
    "stripecfml": {
        "apiKey": getSystemSetting( "STRIPE_API_KEY" ),
        "endpointSecret": getSystemSetting( "STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET" )
    }
};
```

More information about endpoint secrets can be found on [Stripe's website](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures).
